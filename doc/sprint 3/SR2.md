We don’t have any unfinished tasks from this sprint.

Practices that we should continue with during the next sprints are: good communication, frequent meetings, and productive coding sessions. 

Some new practices that we want to use for the next sprints are: doing a better job of estimating how long a task will take and planning our time to include debugging and testing.

We did not have any harmful practices during this sprint. Hopefully we won’t have any in the coming sprints either.

Our worst experience in this sprint was having to solve some issues with libraries on the VM. We would have everything working locally, but then moving it to the VM would break things. We encountered an issue where after installing a library on the VM, the library would still be missing. If we tried to install it again, it would not work because the library is already installed. 
Our best experience during sprint 1 was spending quality time working together and gaining valuable experience. Our group worked well together and everyone worked diligently to complete the tasks on time and to the best of their ability.
