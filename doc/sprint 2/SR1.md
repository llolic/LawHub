We don’t have any unfinished tasks from this sprint.

Practices that we should continue with during the next sprints are: good communication, frequent meetings, and productive coding sessions. 

Some new practices that we want to use for the next sprints are: setting deadlines for user stories and tasks, and making a standup schedule at the very beginning of the sprint.

We did not have any harmful practices during this sprint. Hopefully we won’t have any in the coming sprints either.

Our worst experience in this sprint was some inconsistent python libraries for postgresql. There were issues with using postgresql with python and we spent too much time trying to figure it out. We ended up having to switch to mysql.
Our best experience during sprint 1 was spending quality time working together and gaining valuable experience. Our group worked well together and everyone worked diligently to complete the tasks on time and to the best of their ability.
