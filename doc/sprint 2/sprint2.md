- Shahmeer Shahid
- Alfonso Dela Cruz
- Michelle Luo

## Team Capacity

Team capacity is calculated as follows: 

    (Number of team members) * (days in the sprint) * (productive hours in a day)

We have 5 team members, 14 days in a sprint and approximately 3.8 hours of productive hours a day (3 for weekdays and 6 for weekends).
This gives us a total team capacity of 
    
    Team capacity = 5 * 3.8 * 14 = 266

## Sprint Goals

For this sprint, we want a recruiter to be able to register as well as have both a student and recruiter be able to customize their profiles. By the end of this sprint, a recruiter would be able to create a quiz and a student would be able to complete a quiz.

## Spikes

One of the spikes for this sprint will be the database schema. We will need to find a simple and efficient way to store quizzes, and the questions associated with them. Because MySQL does not allow attributes in tables to be lists, we will need to create relations that link other tables and have the appropriate foreign key constraints.

Another spike will be time management. The team members all have multiple other computer science courses with assignments and/or midterms during this sprint. We will need to work efficiently and plan our time well to be able to complete everything correctly and on time.

Further, we will most likely run into some issues with our VM and downloading libraries as the VM is a bit different than a regular OS. We might also have issues transferring our program or pieces of code onto the VM if developing was done on our own PCs. We will need to read documentation specifically for VMs to make sure we install the libraries correctly from the start to save time that would otherwise be wasted on debugging.
